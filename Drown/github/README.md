# Drown

![Alt text](./drown.png)


## Overview

Work **with**  or **against** your friends to open the dens before you drown in a sea of creatures. 

Land spears to earn points. Points net you weapons, revives, and ultimately... your escape.

## Store
To open the store to purchase items, check the Remix setting for your key. By default, it's set to the Spectator button from Rain Meadow.

## Credits
May all the best parts of this mod go to the Lord Jesus Christ, and all the worst parts be opened as a GitHub issue.
